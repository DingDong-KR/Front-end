 <p  align="center"><b> Enable rapid delivery of medical information in non-networked medical volunteer sites! </b></p>
<br>

Medical volunteers around the world are still suffering from patient bottlenecks due to difficulties in communicating information with poor Internet environments.<br>
Our DingDong team was launched to solve this situation using **Electronic Medical Record** and **Ad-hoc Network**

## üìÑ Abstract

 Wired network infrastructure, which many medical humanitarian groups use, is taking up too much time and can be damaged so easily.  <br>
 <br>
 Our challenge is to provide more time and agility to the team.<br>
 <br>

 Due to the lack of internet access, most medical groups have been using cables to facilitate communication between staffs.<br>
 <br>
However, setting wired network takes up a lot of time.<br>
<br>
It is the main reason why medical staffs can‚Äôt attend the patients as early as they want. <br>
<br>

Also, it causes staff overwork and stress. Because setting wired network shortened the time that should be used to diagnose and treat patients,<br>
<br>
staffs feel like they‚Äôre pressed for time. This reduces service quality and the number of patients, hindering achieving our goal.  <br>
<br>
 Also, cables are vulnerable to physical damages. Medical areas are exposed to various outbreaks like natural disaster, bomb attacks, etc.<br>
 <br>
 When the team faces those threats, the team must move very quickly to avoid further damages.<br>
 <br>
 However, wired network is vulnerable and sluggish. What if the cable is cut? <br>
 <br>
 What if the hospital must move to another place several times in a row?<br>
 <br>
 Wireless infrastructure can better protect the team, making the team agile to the changes.<br>
 
  
### üìÑ UN SDG
![image](https://github.com/Chartify-KR/Front-end/assets/111236793/31b5f28b-1f70-4061-a751-a4da40946650)

Inspired by the product manager‚Äôs experience, Dingdong Chart chose ‚ÄòGood Health and Wellbeing‚Äô as the goal to achieve. <br>
<br>
Our product manager is currently running a medical volunteer group in a medical school and felt inconvenience of using paper chart. <br>
<br>
While searching other groups for a hint, we found out that even other medical humanitarian organizations, even big groups like M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res or Samsung Seoul Hospital, suffer from similar limits.  <br>
<br>
In the goal, UN aims to decrease several indicators like maternal mortality, which are problem mainly in developing countries. <br>
 <br>
But due to the poor road infrastructure and economic level of the countries, humanitarian organization must visit people rather than waiting for them to come.<br>
<br>
That means medical staffs will face tough conditions requiring swift changes where time is everything that matters. <br>
<br>
‚ÄúHealthy people are the foundation for healthy economies‚Äù, UN said. Team Dingdong resonates with the agenda and will help the teams achieve the goal by providing efficient communication tool.


### Good Health and Wellbeing

#### Target
Medical volunteers in fields
#### Problem
Due to the vulnerability of medical facilities in fields, it is hard to communicate medical information
#### Resolve
We have addressed this issue by introducing ###Local network-based EHR

## üòé Expectation 
Improved diagnosis and treatment system through accurate and rapid exchange of information between medical volunteers

Providing more equitable care by reducing the time a patient is seen per medical volunteer


## üõ£ Architecture

</p>
Medical volunteer activity can be divided into three main teams: pre-examination, main-examination, and treatment. <br>
<br>
So, taking inspiration from distributed computing, we designated a hub computer for each team and transmitted data generated from each node computer to the hub computer.<br>
<br>
In addition, the hub computer was able to exchange data by communicating with the hub computers of other teams.<br>
<br>
Data integrity is maintained by storing hub computer's data in the internet environment after the fieldwork.<br>
<br>
Uses Firebase to store medical data, synchronizing data among users in the same affiliation before they participate in the medical activity.<br>
