 <p  align="center"><b> Enable rapid delivery of medical information in non-networked medical volunteer sites! </b></p>
<br>

Medical volunteers around the world are still suffering from patient bottlenecks due to difficulties in communicating information with poor Internet environments.<br>
Our DingDong team was launched to solve this situation using **Electronic Medical Record** and **Ad-hoc Network**

## üìÑ Abstract

In current condition, setting digital infrastructure takes the longest time in setting up the hospital because numerous cables must connect each device.  <br>
<br>

In places like field hospital, where every second is valuable, saving lives should be put first in any case. <br>
As medical staffs don‚Äôt have enough time to diagnose and cure each patient, insufficient treatment time could deteriorate the quality of the medical services in the long term. <br>
<br>
Also, changes occur at any time in a field hospital. It may be the natural disaster, battle, or bomb terror. In those cases, the team faces urgent need to change their route. <br>
<br>

Current cable-based digital environment in field hospital takes too much setup time. <br>
<br>
It shortens the time needed to save the patients and makes the team vulnerable to changes. <br>
<br>

Also, cable-based digital environment is vulnerable to those outbreaks. What if the cable is damaged? What if the hospital must take atypical shape that the cable environment cannot afford? <br>
<br>
Using wireless infrastructure prevents these worries from the first place, making the team agile to the changes. <br>
<br>
Our challenge is to shorten the set-up time by replacing current digital environment into wireless environment, using Ad-hoc technology. <br>

### üìÑ UN SDG

Inspired by the product manager‚Äôs experience, Dingdong Chart chose ‚ÄòGood Health and Wellbeing‚Äô as the goal to achieve. <br>
<br>
Our product manager is currently running a medical volunteer group in a medical school and felt inconvenience of using paper chart. <br>
<br>
While searching other groups for a hint, we found out that even other medical humanitarian organizations, even big groups like M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res or Samsung Seoul Hospital, suffer from similar limits.  <br>
<br>
In the goal, UN aims to decrease several indicators like maternal mortality, which are problem mainly in developing countries. <br>
 <br>
But due to the poor road infrastructure and economic level of the countries, humanitarian organization must visit people rather than waiting for them to come.<br>
<br>
That means medical staffs will face tough conditions requiring swift changes where time is everything that matters. <br>
<br>
‚ÄúHealthy people are the foundation for healthy economies‚Äù, UN said. Team Dingdong resonates with the agenda and will help the teams achieve the goal by providing efficient communication tool.


### Good Health and Wellbeing

#### Target
Medical volunteers in fields
#### Problem
Due to the vulnerability of medical facilities in fields, it is hard to communicate medical information
#### Resolve
We have addressed this issue by introducing ###Local network-based EHR

## üòé Expectation 
Improved diagnosis and treatment system through accurate and rapid exchange of information between medical volunteers

Providing more equitable care by reducing the time a patient is seen per medical volunteer


## üõ£ Architecture

</p>
Medical volunteer activity can be divided into three main teams: pre-examination, main-examination, and treatment. <br>
<br>
So, taking inspiration from distributed computing, we designated a hub computer for each team and transmitted data generated from each node computer to the hub computer.<br>
<br>
In addition, the hub computer was able to exchange data by communicating with the hub computers of other teams.<br>
<br>
Data integrity is maintained by storing hub computer's data in the internet environment after the fieldwork.<br>
<br>
Uses Firebase to store medical data, synchronizing data among users in the same affiliation before they participate in the medical activity.<br>
